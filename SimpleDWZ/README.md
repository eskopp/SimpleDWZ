## Expose
My developed tool allows chess clubs to track their skill development similar to the German Chess Federation, but without the hefty price tag they demand for an official evaluation. Unlike the German Chess Federation, which demands a significant amount of money for rating calculations, my tool offers a cost-effective alternative.

Instead of exploiting clubs financially, my tool provides a fair opportunity to track DWZ development. It is based on the same calculation methods as the German Chess Federation and takes into account players' performance in tournaments or matches. Through regular updates, clubs can analyze their skill development transparently and without exorbitant costs.

Furthermore, my tool provides features to visualize DWZ development without any additional charges, as it is completely free and open-source. Clubs can generate charts and graphs to identify trends and visually represent players' progress.

So why spend a substantial amount of money on the German Chess Federation when my tool offers a cost-effective and reliable alternative? It's time for clubs to invest their hard-earned money wisely and free themselves from the expensive offerings of an official evaluation. My tool is ready to assist clubs in effectively and budget-friendly tracking their DWZ development.
